# Wattson Heirloom

<img src="./assets/wattson-heirloom.jpg" style="width: 100%;" />

Wattson is a character from the video game [Apex Legends](https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends). This is a project to build a 3D-printed version of her "Telemetry Receiver Module" [Heirloom](https://apexlegends.fandom.com/wiki/Heirloom), with functioning electronics (not a real radar, thought).
