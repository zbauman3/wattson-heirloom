# Parts Info

These are all of the parts that were bought to build this project. There were some odds and ends that I already owned and cannot find a good link for (plugs, wires, etc).

## Filament

I used Prusa PETG for all of the filament. The colors used were Orange, White, and Anthracite Grey.

## NeoPixels

The four rods on the end are each covered with one 28-pixel strip. The rods are all wired in parallel.

## Perma-Proto Board

This board is meant to be used with a Raspberry Pi, but after looking at its size and layout, it proved perfect for mounting the QTPY ESP32-S2, MCP23017, and EEPROM.

## QTPY ESP32 S2

The main MCU.

## MCP23017

An I2C I/O expander. I likely could have used less inputs for the buttons, but this seemed simpler.
